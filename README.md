# Predicting Stock Prices Using LSTM

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices.

## Description

Stock price prediction is a popular application of deep learning. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited to this task because they can capture long-term dependencies and can handle variable-length input sequences.

This repository includes Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate how to use LSTM networks to predict stock prices. The notebooks are based on the Keras deep learning library and use historical stock price data to predict future stock prices.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
